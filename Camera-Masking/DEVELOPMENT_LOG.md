# Development Log - Camera Motion Detection App

## Project Timeline

### August 26, 2025 - Initial Development & Debugging Session

#### Goals Achieved ‚úÖ
1. **Multi-Object Motion Detection Implementation**
   - Successfully implemented detection of up to 3 simultaneous moving objects
   - Added color-coded rectangle tracking (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta)
   - Implemented object numbering system

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Migrated from RGB to YUV processing for better performance
   - Achieved 20-30 FPS (target: 60 FPS)
   - Implemented adaptive scale factors based on resolution
   - Added efficient memory management with buffer reuse

3. **Portrait Mode Stabilization**
   - Fixed orientation switching issues via AndroidManifest configuration
   - Enforced portrait mode to prevent landscape-related crashes
   - Added configChanges handling for stability

4. **Resolution Management**
   - Prioritized 1080p camera resolution with fallback options
   - Implemented adaptive processing parameters based on resolution
   - Added comprehensive camera capability detection

5. **Advanced Motion Detection Features**
   - Adaptive thresholding (threshold=20)
   - Morphological operations for noise reduction
   - Minimum area filtering (400 pixels)
   - Real-time FPS monitoring and object counting

#### Current Issues üîß

**Primary Issue: Coordinate Transformation**
- **Problem**: Motion detection algorithm correctly identifies and counts objects, but drawn rectangles don't appear at the correct screen positions
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Objects detected correctly (logs show "obj 2", "obj 3" etc.)
  - Rectangles are drawn but appear in wrong locations
  - Detection works but positioning is completely off
- **Root Cause**: Coordinate transformation between YUV processing space and screen overlay space is incorrect

**Technical Details:**
- YUV processing dimensions vs. screen overlay dimensions mismatch
- Camera preview coordinates not properly mapped to screen coordinates
- Possible issues with aspect ratio scaling, rotation handling, or coordinate system orientation

#### Debugging Approaches Attempted üîç

1. **Coordinate Validation**
   - Added extensive logging for original rect coordinates
   - Implemented coordinate bounds checking
   - Added fallback rectangles for invalid coordinates

2. **Multiple Transformation Methods**
   - Method 1: Direct scaling
   - Method 2: X-axis flipped
   - Method 3: Y-axis flipped
   - Method 4: Both axes flipped
   - Visual debugging with different colors for each method

3. **Layout Analysis**
   - Verified overlay positioning in activity_main.xml
   - Confirmed transparent background and proper layout parameters
   - Checked camera preview and overlay alignment

4. **Scale Factor Debugging**
   - Logged YUV dimensions vs. canvas dimensions
   - Calculated and validated scale factors
   - Added boundary checking for transformed coordinates

#### Code Architecture Status üìã

**Core Components Working:**
- `detectMotionFromYUV()`: Motion detection algorithm ‚úÖ
