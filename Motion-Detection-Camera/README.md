## Introduction
The Motion Detection Security Camera is an enterprise-grade surveillance solution leveraging Python and OpenCV for real-time motion detection and automated evidence capture. Designed for reliability and scalability, it enables organizations to enhance security monitoring and incident response.

## Business Value
- Automates security monitoring, reducing manual oversight
- Provides actionable evidence for compliance and investigations
- Easily integrates with existing infrastructure
- Scalable for deployment across multiple locations

## Features
- Real-time video capture from webcam or external camera
- Motion detection using advanced frame differencing algorithms
- Automatic recording and storage of motion events
- Configurable snapshot and video evidence capture
- Event logging for audit and review

## Architecture
The system is modular, with components for video acquisition, motion analysis, event handling, and evidence management. It is designed for extensibility, supporting future integration with cloud services, IoT devices, and AI-based analytics.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – Image processing & motion detection
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) – Array computations
  - [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) – Event timestamping
  - [OS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) – File handling
